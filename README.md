## Description

The CYSINTH is an innovative tangible interface for creating music and visuals. Utilizing our CIS instrument, the CISYNTH generates a UDP stream containing thousands of values captured by both the contact image sensor and the inertial measurement unit, transmitted at frequencies of up to 1kHz. This stream can be used to generate music or display image streams in Max/MSP, Pure Data, and our application.
